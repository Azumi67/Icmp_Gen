- I'm going to work on this tunnel, I need to change the original programmer's code and use it to bypass any kind of restrictions on the Iran server so I can play my games happily forever.
- I will list the tasks i need to do here as a reminder for myself.
- 1- UDP tunnel + IPSEC
- 2- gen + ipsec
- 2-1: vxlan
- 3- ICMP v6 code rewrite (need c++)
- 4- use icmp with gen and other udp based tunnels combined with forward error control
- 5- Rathole Binay
- 6- RTCF + ICMP + GEN
- 7- FRP 10 Kharej 2 Iran
- 8- Testing reverse tunnels with FEC
- 9- Encryption within the server and using local IP to send the packets inside another encrypted packet to the destination.
- 10- icmp + dns + buffer
- 11- DNS + UDP tunnels
- 12- tc & speed limiter & fire qos
- 13- another reverse tunnel
- 14- Another direct tunnel
- 15- Wireguard Panel Features( starting from first usage- enable disable feature- telegram bot- ipv6 available ip- auto start wireguard interface)
- 16- maybe gost v3 for self usage
- 17- 64 tunnels and port forward with encryption.
- 18- reverse tls mutli iran | kharej server
- 19- rathole mutli port test
- 20- similar frp tunnel
- 21-
